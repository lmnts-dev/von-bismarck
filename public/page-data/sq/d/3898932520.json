{"data":{"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Von Bismarck - Reno","longDescription":"Von Bismarck is a modern family style restaurant inspired by the traditions of Eastern and Northern Europe with a focus on low intervention wine and traditional beer styles. Helmed by Chef Scott Arn, formerly of Mugaritz, Von Bismarck aims to focus the best of the old world through a modern lens and present it in an atmosphere of conviviality and generosity. We believe communal seating and family style presentation are conducive to this end. Sharing a meal, whether with those you love or complete strangers is essential to the human experience and all of us here at Von Bismarck hope to help you on that journey.","author":"@laxaltandmciver"}}}}
